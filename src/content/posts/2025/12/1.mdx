welcome to my website! after (very) much work i've finally got the site to a state that i'm happy with :3
i became very hyperfixated on it right before my final exams but had to prioritise my uni work and 
haven't really had the same motivation since, so i've backdated a lot of the content before the post.
hopefully i'll be able to keep things up to date now that i've finished the main structure of the site,
but i apologise if not, my focus tends to be very single-pointed and unpredictable. at least i'll have a
place to put my projects from now on!
